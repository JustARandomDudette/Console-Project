    <p>To set up Visual Studio, go to their website and click Download. Just keep on clicking next until you reach the main tab. Then go to Extensions and add Preview Live Stream. Once you install it, you can start. Then you go to file and click on open folder. Then make a new folder and select it. Right click below it on New File and rename it index.html. To run the code in the browser, you should have an icon on the very bottom, the blue tab. If you don't, click on "Run" and click "Start Debugging". You can use Visual Studio for several code languages. Visual Studio is a fun and easy to navigate coding IDE, so have fun and happy coding!</p>
<p>Now let us learn about console. The Console is where the user writes code and immediately sees the output. To reach it, just go to your regular browser. Right click and click on Inspect. Then you will see "Elements, Console, Sources, and Network". Click on Console. Then write your code. Click enter to see the result. To log or insert a piece of data into the console, do the command: console.log("what you want to log); It is very fun and easy!</p>
